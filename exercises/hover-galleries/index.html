                    We have to break it to you that tongue is not the 
                    strongest muscle in the body. The tongue itself is a 
                    muscle and it contains at least eight different 
                    muscles which are intertwine by creating a very 
                    flexible matrix. The strongest muscle in the body is 
                    Masseter which is responsible for lifting up the jaw.

                    Yes, surprising right? But not in the way we 
                    interpret sleep. James and Cottel have conducted 
                    research which shows that ants have a cyclical 
                    pattern of resting periods where each nest respite 
                    collectively which lasts for around eight minutes 
                    in a 12-hour period.

                    Yes, this is true, as per the calculation it is 
                    said that a person will weigh 0.48g lighter 
                    for a 100kg person. When the moon is directly 
                    overhead, they are going to weigh 0.5g lighter as the 
                    moon attracts you in the same way it attracts 
                    water when it makes tides.

                    Indeed true, Celsius and Fahrenheit are two 
                    different temperature scales. The Fahrenheit 
                    and Celsius intersect at one point and they equal
