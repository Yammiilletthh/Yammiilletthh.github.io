                Fashion is a term used interchangeably to describe the creation 
                of clothing, footwear, accessories, cosmetics, and jewellery 
                of different cultural aesthetics and their mix and match 
                into outfits that depict distinctive ways of dressing 
                (styles and trends) as signifiers of social status, 
                self-expression, and group belonging. As a multifaceted term, 
                fashion describes an industry, styles, aesthetics, and trends.
            </p>

            <p>
                The term 'fashion' originates from the Latin word 'Facere,' 
                which means 'to make,' and describes the manufacturing, mixing, 
                and wearing of outfits adorned with specific cultural aesthetics, 
                patterns, motifs, shapes, and cuts, allowing people to showcase 
                their group belonging, values, meanings, beliefs, and ways of life. 
                Given the rise in mass production of commodities and clothing at 
                lower prices and global reach, reducing fashion's environmental 
                impact and improving sustainability has become an urgent issue among 
                politicians, brands, and consumers.[1][2]

            <h1 id="history2">History of fashion</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Changes in clothing often took place at times of economic or 
                social change, as occurred in ancient Rome and the medieval Caliphate, 
                followed by a long period without significant changes. 
                In eighth-century Moorish Spain, the musician Ziryab introduced 
                to Córdoba[14][unreliable source][15] sophisticated clothing styles 
                based on seasonal and daily fashions from his native Baghdad, 
                modified by his inspiration. Similar changes in fashion occurred 
                in the 11th century in the Middle East following the arrival of the 
                Turks, who introduced clothing styles from Central Asia and the Far East.
                [16]

            <p>
                Early Western travellers who visited India, Persia, 
                Turkey, or China, would frequently remark on the absence 
                of change in fashion in those countries. In 1609, the secretary 
                of the Japanese shōgun bragged inaccurately to a Spanish visitor t
                hat Japanese clothing had not changed in over a thousand years.
                [17]: 312–313  However, these conceptions of non-Western clothing 
                undergoing little, if any, evolution are generally held to be untrue; 
                for instance, there is considerable evidence in Ming China of rapidly 
                changing fashions in Chinese clothing.[18] In imperial China, clothing 
                were not only an embodiment of freedom and comfort or used to cover 
                the body or protect against the cold or used for decorative purposes; 
                it was also regulated by strong sumptuary laws which was based on strict 
                social hierarchy system and the ritual system of the Chinese society.
                [19]: 14–15  It was expected for people to be dressed accordingly to 
                their gender, social status and occupation; the Chinese clothing 
                system had cleared evolution and varied in appearance in each period 
                of history

                In its most common use, the term fashion refers to the current 
                expressions on sale through the fashion industry. The global 
                fashion industry is a product of the modern age.[38] 
                In the Western world, tailoring has since medieval times been 
                controlled by guilds, but with the emergence of industrialism, 
                the power of the guilds was undermined. Before the mid-19th century, 
                most clothing was custom-made. It was handmade for individuals, 
                either as home production or on order from dressmakers and tailors. 
                By the beginning of the 20th century, with the rise of new technologies 
                such as the sewing machine, the rise of global trade, the development 
                of the factory system of production, and the proliferation of retail 
                outlets such as department stores, clothing became increasingly 
                mass-produced in standard sizes and sold at fixed prices.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although the fashion industry developed first in Europe 
                and America, as of 2017, it is an international and highly 
                globalized industry, with clothing often designed in one 
                country, manufactured in another, and sold worldwide. 
                For example, an American fashion company might source 
                fabric in China and have the clothes manufactured in 
                Vietnam, finished in Italy, and shipped to a warehouse 
                in the United States for distribution to retail outlets 
                internationally.
            </p>
            <p>
                The fashion industry has for a long time been one of 
                the largest employers in the United States,[38] and it 
                remains so in the 21st century. However, U.S. employment 
                in fashion began to decline considerably as production 
                increasingly moved overseas, especially to China. 
                Because data regarding the fashion industry typically 
                are reported for national economies and expressed in 
                terms of the industry's many separate sectors, aggregate 
                figures for the world production of textiles and clothing 
                are difficult to obtain. However, by any measure, the 
                clothing industry accounts for a significant share of 
                world economic output.[39] The fashion industry consists 
                of four levels:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The production of raw materials, 
                    principally fiber, and textiles but also leather and fur.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The production of fashion goods by designers, 
                    manufacturers, contractors, and others.
                </li>
                <li>Retail Sales.</li>
                <li>Various forms of advertising and promotion.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The levels of focus in the fashion industry consist of 
                many separate but interdependent sectors. These sectors 
                include textile design and production, fashion design and
                manufacturing, fashion retailing, marketing and merchandising, 
                fashion shows, and media and marketing. Each sector is devoted 
                to the goal of satisfying consumer demand for apparel under 
                conditions that enable participants in the industry to operate 
                at a profit.[38]
            </p>
            <h3 id="trends5">Fashion Trends</h3>
            <p>
                A fashion trend signifies a specific look or expression 
                that is spread across a population at a specific 
                time and place. A trend is considered a more ephemeral 
                look, not defined by the seasons when collections are 
                released by the fashion industry. A trend can thus emerge 
                from street style, across cultures, and from influencers 
                and other celebrities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fashion trends are influenced by several factors, 
                including cinema, celebrities, climate, creative 
                explorations, innovations, designs, political, economic, 
                social, and technological. Examining these factors 
                is called a PEST analysis. Fashion forecasters can use 
                this information to help determine the growth or decline 
                of a particular trend.
            </p>
            <p>
                People's minds as well as their perceptions and 
                consciousness are constantly changing. Fads are 
                inherently social, are constantly evolving in a 
                contradiction between the old and the new, and 
                are in a sense easily influenced by those around 
                them, and therefore also begin to imitate constantly.[40]
            </p>
            <h3 id="political6">Political Influences</h3>
            <p>
                Political figures have played a central role in the 
                development of fashion, at least since the time of 
                French king Louis XIV. For example, First 
                Lady Jacqueline Kennedy was a fashion 
                icon of the early 1960s. Wearing Chanel suits, 
                structural Givenchy shift dresses, and soft color 
                Cassini coats with large buttons, she inspired trends 
                of both elegant formal dressing and classic 
                feminine style.[73]
            </p>
            <p>
                Cultural upheavals have also had an impact on fashion trends.
                 For example, during the 1960s, the U.S. economy was robust, 
                 the divorce rate was increasing, and the government 
                 approved the birth control pill. These factors 
                 inspired the younger generation to rebel against 
                 entrenched social norms. The civil rights movement, 
                 a struggle for social justice and equal opportunity for 
                 Blacks, and the women's liberation movement, seeking equal 
                 rights and opportunities and greater personal freedom 
                 for women, were in full bloom. In 1964, the leg-baring 
                 mini-skirt was introduced and became a white-hot trend. 
                 Fashion designers then began to experiment with the 
                 shapes of garments: loose sleeveless dresses, micro-minis, 
                 flared skirts, and trumpet sleeves. Fluorescent colors, 
                 print patterns, bell-bottom jeans, fringed vests, and 
                 skirts became de rigueur outfits of the 1960s.[74]
            </p>
            <p>
                Concern and protest over U.S. involvement in the failing 
                Vietnam War also influenced fashion. Camouflage patterns 
                in military clothing, developed to help military 
                personnel be less visible to enemy forces, seeped into 
                streetwear designs in the 1960s. Camouflage trends have 
                disappeared and resurfaced several times since then, 
                appearing in high fashion iterations in the 1990s.[75] 
                Designers such as Valentino, Dior, and Dolce & Gabbana 
                combined camouflage into their runway and ready-to-wear 
                collections. Today, variations of camouflage, including 
                pastel shades, in every article of clothing or accessory, 
                continue to enjoy popularity.
            </p>
            <h3 id="technology7">Technology Influences</h3>
            <p>
                Today, technology plays a sizable role in society, and 
                technological influences are correspondingly increasing 
                within the realm of fashion. Wearable technology has 
                become incorporated; for example, clothing constructed 
                with solar panels that charge devices and smart fabrics 
                that enhance wearer comfort by changing color or texture 
                based on environmental changes.[76] 3D printing technology 
                has influenced designers such as Iris van Herpen and 
                Kimberly Ovitz. As the technology evolves, 3D printers 
                will become more accessible to designers and eventually, 
                consumers — these could potentially reshape design and 
                production in the fashion industry entirely.
            </p>
            <p>
                Internet technology, enabling the far reaches of online retailers 
                and social media platforms, has created previously unimaginable 
                ways for trends to be identified, marketed, and sold immediately.
                [77] Trend-setting styles are easily displayed and communicated 
                online to attract customers. Posts on Instagram or Facebook can 
                quickly increase awareness about new trends in fashion, which 
                subsequently may create high demand for specific items or brands,
                [78] new "buy now button" technology can link these styles with 
                direct sales.
            </p>
            <p>
                Machine vision technology has been developed to track how 
                fashions spread through society. The industry can now see 
                the direct correlation on how fashion shows influence 
                street-chic outfits. Effects such as these can now be 
                quantified and provide valuable feedback to fashion houses, 
                designers, and consumers regarding trends.[79]
