                    Hello! My name is Cypher My favorite thing in the whole wide 
                    world besides my foster-peeps is my spikey blue ball. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am young and have great energy. I get really 
                    excited when I meet new people and bark REALLY BIG. 
                    But don't let that scare you away. While it's great 
                    for keeping burglars away, what they don't know is, 
                    I'm everyone's friend once I get a chance to meet them. 
                    I can be picky about treats but that is ok. I am also a great 
                    listener without them. If you adopt me and give me guidance, 
                    I'm all ears to listen to what you want me to know and do. 
                    This means treats or not, I will behave when you tell me 
                    to calm or do other things. I'm also up for learning new 
                    things with you!
                </p>
