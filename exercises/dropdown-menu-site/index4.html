                <p>
                    Fufu is a beautiful Russian blues, with their 
                    smooth blue/grey fur. She was born outside. The residents had 
                    found homes for the kittens from prior litters, 
                    but this time there were no more homes for these babies. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fufu has a bigger white spot in her chest. 
                    While Fufu will sit for purrs and cuddles, 
                    she immediately perks up for play. She absolutely 
                    loves the wand toys and has recently discovered catnip 
                    toys are pretty fun too. She in a foster 
                    home with other cats and two dogs. She would love 
                    to go to a new home with a sibling or other kitten 
                    around the same age for double fun.
