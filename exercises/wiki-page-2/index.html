            </a>
            whose activity consists in projecting visual 
            communications intended to transmit 
            specific messages to social groups, 
            with specific objectives.<a href="#"><sup>[6]</sup></a> Graphic 
            design is an interdisciplinary branch 
            of <a href="#">design<sup>[1]</sup></a> and of the 
            <a href="#">fine arts.</a>
            Its practice involves <a href="#">creativity, 
            innovation</a> and<a href="#">lateral thinking</a> using 
            manual or <a href="#">digital tools,</a> where it is usual 
            to use text and graphics to communicate visually.
        </p>

        <p>
            The role of the<a href="#">graphic designer</a> in the communication 
            process is that of encoder or interpreter of the message. 
            They work on the interpretation, ordering, and 
            presentation of visual messages. Usually, 
            graphic design uses the <a href="#">aesthetics</a> of 
            <a href="#">typography</a> and the compositional 
            arrangement of the text,ornamentation, and imagery to convey 
            ideas, feelings, and attitudes beyond what language 
            alone expresses. 
            The design work can be based on a customer's demand, 
            a demand that ends up being established linguistically, 
            either orally or in writing, that is, that graphic design 
            transforms a linguistic message into a graphic 
            manifestation.<a href="#"><sup>[7]</sup></a>
        </p>

        <p>
            Graphic design has, as a field of application, 
            different areas of knowledge focused on any 
            visual communication system. For example, it 
            can be applied in advertising strategies, or 
            it can also be applied in the .
            <a href="#">aviation</a> world<a href="#"><sup>[8]</sup></a>
            or <a href="#">space exploration.</a>
            <a href="#"><sup>[9][10]</sup></a> In this sense, in 
            some countries graphic design is related as only 
            associated with the production of sketches 
            and drawings, this is incorrect, since visual 
            communication is a small part of a huge range 
            of types and classes where it can be applied.
        </p>
        <p>
            With origins in <a href="#">Antiquity</a> and the 
            Middle Ages,<sup>[11]</sup></a>
            graphic design as applied art was initially 
            linked to the boom of <a href="#">rise of printing</a> in 
            Europe in the 15th century and the growth 
            of consumer culture in the <a href="#">Industrial Revolution.</a> 
            From there it emerged as a distinct profession in 
            the West, closely associated with <a href="#">advertising in</a> 
            the 19th century<a href="#"><sup>[12]</sup></a> and its evolution allowed 
            its consolidation in the 20th century. 
            Given the rapid and massive growth in 
            information exchange today, the demand for 
            experienced designers is greater than ever, 
            particularly because of the development of 
            new technologies and the need to pay attention 
            to human factors beyond the competence of the 
            engineers who develop them.<a href="#"><sup>[13]</sup></a>
        </p>

        <p>
            <a href="#">William Addison Dwiggins</a> is often credited with 
            first using the term "graphic design" in a 1922 
            article,<a href="#"><sup>[14]</sup></a> although it appears in a 4 July 
            1908 issue (volume 9, number 27) of Organized 
            Labor, a publication of the Labor Unions 
            of San Francisco, in an article about 
            technical education for printers:[15]
        </p>

        <p>
            An Enterprising Trades Union
            … The admittedly high standard of intelligence 
            which prevails among printers is an assurance 
            that with the elemental principles of design at 
            their finger ends many of them will grow in 
            knowledge and develop into specialists in 
            graphic design and decorating. …
        </p>

        <p>
            A decade later, the 1917–1918 course catalog 
            of the California School of Arts & Crafts 
            advertised a course titled Graphic Design and 
            Lettering, which replaced one called Advanced 
            Design and Lettering. Both classes were taught 
            by Frederick Meyer.[16]

        <p>
            In both its lengthy history and in the 
            relatively recent explosion of visual 
            communication in the 20th and 21st centuries, 
            the distinction between advertising, art, 
            graphic design and fine art has disappeared. 
            They share many elements, theories, principles, 
            practices, languages and sometimes the same 
            benefactor or client. In advertising, the ultimate 
            objective is the sale of goods and services. 
            In graphic design, "the essence is to give order 
            to information, form to ideas, expression, 
            and feeling to artifacts that document the 
            human experience."[17]

        <h4> The advent of printing</h3>
        <p><i>Main article: History of printing</i></p>

        <p>In China, during the Tang dynasty 
            (618–907) wood blocks were cut to 
            print on textiles and later to reproduce 
            Buddhist texts. A Buddhist scripture printed 
            in 868 is the earliest known printed book. 
            Beginning in the 11th century in China, 
            longer scrolls and books were produced using 
            movable type printing, making books widely 
            available during the Song dynasty (960–1279).[18]
        </p>

        <p>In the mid-15th century in Mainz, Germany, 
            Johannes Gutenberg developed a way to 
            reproduce printed pages at a faster pace 
            using movable type made with a new metal 
            alloy[19] that created a revolution in the 
            dissemination of information.[20]
        </p>

        <h3>Nineteenth century</h3>
        
        <p>
            In 1849, Henry Cole became one of the major 
            forces in design education in Great Britain, 
            informing the government of the importance of 
            design in his Journal of Design and Manufactures. 
            He organized the Great Exhibition as a celebration 
            of modern industrial technology and Victorian design.
        </p>

        <p>From 1891 to 1896, William Morris' Kelmscott 
            Press was a leader in graphic design 
            associated with the Arts and Crafts movement, 
            creating hand-made books in medieval and 
            Renaissance era style,[21] in addition to 
            wallpaper and textile designs.[22] Morris' 
            work, along with the rest of the Private Press 
            movement, directly influenced Art Nouveau.[23]
        </p>

        <p>
            Will H. Bradley became one of the notable 
            graphic designers in the late nineteenth-century 
            due to creating art pieces in various Art 
            Nouveau styles. Bradley created a number of 
            designs as promotions for a literary magazine 
            titled The Chap-Book.[24]

        <h3>Twentieth century</h3>
        <p>
            In 1917, Frederick H. Meyer, director 
            and instructor at the California School 
            of Arts and Crafts, taught a class entitled 
            "Graphic Design and Lettering".[25] Raffe's 
            Graphic Design, published in 1927, was the first 
            book to use "Graphic Design" in its title.[26] In 1936, 
            author and graphic designer Leon Friend published 
            his book titled "Graphic Design" and it is known to 
            be the first piece of literature to cover the topic 
            extensively.[27]
        </p>

        <p>
            The signage in the London Underground 
            is a classic design example[28] of the 
            modern era. Although he lacked artistic 
            training, Frank Pick led the Underground 
            Group design and publicity movement. 
            The first Underground station signs were 
            introduced in 1908 with a design of a solid 
            red disk with a blue bar in the center and 
            the name of the station. The station name 
            was in white sans-serif letters. It was in 1916 
            when Pick used the expertise of Edward Johnston 
            to design a new typeface for the Underground. 
            Johnston redesigned the Underground sign and 
            logo to include his typeface on the blue bar 
            in the center of a red circle.[29]
        </p>

        <p>
            In the 1920s, Soviet constructivism applied 
            'intellectual production' in different spheres 
            of production. The movement saw individualistic 
            art as useless in revolutionary Russia and thus 
            moved towards creating objects for utilitarian purposes. 
            They designed buildings, theater sets, posters, fabrics, 
            clothing, furniture, logos, menus, etc.[30]
        </p>

        <p>
            Jan Tschichold codified the principles of modern 
            typography in his 1928 book, New Typography.[31] 
            He later repudiated the philosophy he espoused in 
            this book as fascistic, but it remained influential.
            [citation needed] Tschichold, Bauhaus typographers 
            such as Herbert Bayer and László Moholy-Nagy and 
            El Lissitzky greatly influenced graphic design. 
            They pioneered production techniques[citation needed] 
            and stylistic devices used throughout the twentieth century. 
            The following years saw graphic design in the modern 
            style gain widespread acceptance and application.[32]
        </p>

        <p>
            The professional graphic design industry 
            grew in parallel with consumerism. 
            This raised concerns and criticisms, notably 
            from within the graphic design community with the 
            First Things First manifesto. First launched 
            by Ken Garland in 1964, it was re-published as the 
            First Things First 2000 manifesto in 1999 in the 
            magazine Emigre 51[33] stating "We propose a reversal 
            of priorities in favor of more useful, lasting and 
            democratic forms of communication – a mindshift away
            from product marketing and toward the exploration and 
            production of a new kind of meaning. The scope of 
            debate is shrinking; it must expand. Consumerism is 
            running uncontested; it must be challenged by 
            other perspectives expressed, in part, through 
            the visual languages and resources of design."[34]

        <h2 id="application1">Applications</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Graphic design can have many applications, 
            from road signs to technical schematics and 
            reference manuals. It is often used in branding 
            products and elements of company identity such as 
            logos, colors, packaging, labelling and text.

        <p>
            From scientific journals to news reporting, 
            the presentation of opinion and facts is often 
            improved with graphics and thoughtful compositions 
            of visual information – known as information design. 
            With the advent of the web, information designers 
            with experience in interactive tools are increasingly 
            used to illustrate the background to news stories. 
            Information design can include Data and information 
            visualization, which involves using programs to 
            interpret and form data into a visually compelling 
            presentation, and can be tied in with information graphics.

        <p>
            The "process school" is concerned with communication; 
            it highlights the channels and media through which 
            messages are transmitted and by which senders and 
            receivers encode and decode these messages. 
            The semiotic school treats a message as a construction 
            of signs which through interaction with receivers, 
            produces meaning; communication as an agent.[citation needed]
        </p>

        <h3>Typography</h3>
        <p><i>Main article: Typography</i></p>

        <p>
            Typography includes type design, modifying 
            type glyphs and arranging type. Type glyphs 
            (characters) are created and modified using 
            illustration techniques. Type arrangement is 
            the selection of typefaces, point size, tracking 
            (the space between all characters used), kerning 
            (the space between two specific characters) and l
            eading (line spacing).
        </p>

        <p>
            Typography is performed by typesetters, 
            compositors, typographers, graphic artists, 
            art directors, and clerical workers. Until the 
            digital age, typography was a specialized occupation. 
            Certain fonts communicate or resemble stereotypical notions. 
            For example, 1942 Report is a font which types text akin 
            to a typewriter or a vintage report.[35]
        </p>
        <h3>Page layout</h3>
        <p><i>Further information: Grid (graphic design)</i></p>

        <p>
            Page layout deals with the arrangement of elements 
            (content) on a page, such as image placement, text 
            layout and style. Page design has always been a 
            consideration in printed material and more recently 
            extended to displays such as web pages. 
            Elements typically consist of type (text), 
            images (pictures), and (with print media) 
            occasionally place-holder graphics such as a 
            dieline for elements that are not printed with 
            ink such as die/laser cutting, foil stamping or 
            blind embossing.
        </p>

        <h3>Grids</h3>

        <p>
            A grid serves as a method of arranging both space 
            and information, allowing the reader to easily 
            comprehend the overall project. Furthermore, 
            a grid functions as a container for information 
            and a means of establishing and maintaining order. 
            Despite grids being utilized for centuries, 
            many graphic designers associate them with Swiss design. 
            The desire for order in the 1940s resulted in a highly 
            systematic approach to visualizing information. However, 
            grids were later regarded as tedious and uninteresting, 
            earning the label of "designersaur." Today, grids are 
            once again considered crucial tools for professionals, 
            whether they are novices or veterans.[36]
