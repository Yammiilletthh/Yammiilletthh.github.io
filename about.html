                            exceptional graphic designer with my own business.One of my passions 
                            is to create art, that I can share with the world. Some of my hobbies 
                            are to be out in nature whether it being hiking, swimming, and camping. 
                            Art has always been a big part of life, I am always looking for inspiration 
                            to create digital art and implement my <b>UX/UI Design, Digital Illustration
